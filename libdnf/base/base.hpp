// lukash: I don't like these aggregate headers; I'm not convinced we need them, but we could add them later if we find out we do?
// lukash: I'd also prefer we just named the source files with all lowercase (probably with dashes as separators, e.g. package-set.hpp, although that seems like another different naming convention, I think it's again quite common. we could do underscores too: package_set.hpp)
