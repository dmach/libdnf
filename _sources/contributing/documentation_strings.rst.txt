Documentation strings
=====================

We use `doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html>`_ + sphinx + breathe to render libdnf documentation.

A typical docstring contains the following:

* Description (mandatory; we don't use @brief as it doesn't seem to impact the rendered output)
* a blank line
* @param - name and description of each argument (only if applicable, can be specified multiple times)
* @return - description of returned value (only if applicable)
* @since - version an entity become available (mandatory)
* @deprecated - reason why an entity is deprecated (only if applicable)


Example::

    /// Split a string by a delimiter into a vector of strings
    ///
    /// @param text             Input text.
    /// @param delimiter        A delimiter we're using to split the text.
    /// @param max_items        Limit number of splits to produce a vector containing up to ``max_items`` items.
    /// @return Splitted text.
    /// @since 1.0
    std::vector<std::string> split(std::string text, std::string delimiter, int max_items);
